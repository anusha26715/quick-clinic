## Challenges Faced and Solutions

- **Routing and Navigation**: Ensuring smooth navigation and handling not-found routes.
  - *Solution*: Used React Router’s `<Routes>` and `<Navigate>` for robust routing and fallback pages.

- **Loader Integration**: Displaying a global loader during lazy loading without disrupting styles.
  - *Solution*: Used React’s `Suspense` with a custom loader overlay.

- **Doctor Availability Validation**: Matching appointment times with each doctor’s schedule.
  - *Solution*: Parsed schedule data and validated user input against available slots in the booking form.

- **Icon Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent icon rendering.
  - *Solution*: Standardized on Bootstrap Icons and updated markup where needed.
